# What I Learned
Building THREADDOT gave me hands-on experience with designing and deploying a production-ready MERN application. Throughout the project, I worked on authentication, authorization, database design, REST APIs, payment integration, image management, deployment, performance optimization, and responsive UI development.
The deployment process also introduced me to practical challenges such as CORS configuration, environment variable management, MongoDB Atlas migration, Linux case sensitivity, and hosting a full-stack application using Vercel and Render.
